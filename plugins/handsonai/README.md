# Hands-on AI

Everything you need to design, build, and document AI workflows.

The AI Workflow Framework as executable skills for Claude, ChatGPT/Codex, and Claude Code, plus a knowledge-graph builder, an AI registry toolkit, and a feature-spec toolkit. One install, one namespace, one mental model.

## Install

One plugin, three places it installs — pick yours. Full step-by-step (with screenshots) on the
[skills setup page](https://handsonai.info/ai-workflow-framework/skills/).

- **Claude** (claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Cowork — paid plans): **Customize → Plugins → + → Add marketplace → Add from a repository** → `jamesgray-ai/handsonai-plugins` → install **handsonai**.
- **ChatGPT** (any paid plan) **and Codex**: **Plugins → Add marketplace** → `jamesgray-ai/handsonai-plugins` → install **Hands-on AI**. Then `@analyze` (ChatGPT) or `$analyze` (Codex).
- **Claude Code**:

  ```
  /plugin marketplace add jamesgray-ai/handsonai-plugins
  /plugin install handsonai@handsonai
  ```

No plugin support on your platform (Claude Free, ChatGPT Free/Go, Gemini, M365 Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI)? Download the skills as ZIPs from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jamesgray-ai/handsonai-plugins/releases/latest).

## Quick Start

1. **Analyze** — Run `/handsonai:analyze` to audit your workflows and identify AI opportunities
2. **Deconstruct** — Run `/handsonai:deconstruct` to break down your highest-impact workflow
3. **Design** — Run `/handsonai:design` to design the architecture
4. **Build** — Run `/handsonai:build` to generate platform artifacts
5. **Test** — Run `/handsonai:test` to validate output quality
6. **Run** — Run `/handsonai:run` to get deployment instructions
7. **Improve** — Run `/handsonai:improve` to evaluate and evolve the workflow

Or run the agent and let it walk you through the whole flow:

```

Outputs are saved to the `outputs/` folder.

## Worked Examples

Looking for example agents and skills (executive writing, editorial review, research, meeting prep, AI news)? They live in the [Example Gallery](https://handsonai.info/use-cases/example-gallery/) on the docs site as study material you can copy and customize for your own workflows.
